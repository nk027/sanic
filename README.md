Routines for solving large systems of linear equations in **R**. Direct and iterative solvers from the [*Eigen*](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) **C++** library are made available. Solvers include Cholesky, LU, QR, and Krylov subspace methods (Conjugate Gradient, BiCGSTAB). Both dense and sparse problems are supported.

Installation
-------

**sanic** is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sanic). The development version can be installed from GitHub.
```r
install.packages("sanic")
devtools::install_github("nk027/sanic")
```

Usage
-------

To solve a linear system of equations, use the `solve2()` function for automatic dispatch to a specific solver or access the LU, QR, Cholesky or Conjugate Gradient solvers directly.

To solve an eigenproblem, use the `eigen2()` or `svd2()` functions, or the `arnoldi()` function.
