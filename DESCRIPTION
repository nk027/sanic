Description: Routines for solving large systems of linear equations and
  eigenproblems in R. Direct and iterative solvers from the Eigen C++ library
  are made available. Solvers include Cholesky, LU, QR, and Krylov subspace
  methods (Conjugate Gradient, BiCGSTAB). Dense and sparse problems are
  supported.
