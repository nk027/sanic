# sanic: Solving Ax = b Nimbly in C++

Routines for solving large systems of linear equations in R. Direct and iterative solvers from the [*Eigen*](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) C++ library are made available. Solvers include Cholesky, LU, QR, and Krylov subspace (Conjugate Gradient, BiCGSTAB) methods. Both dense and sparse problems are supported.
